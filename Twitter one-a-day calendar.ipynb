One of the other beautiful things about Twitter is the vast amount of pedagogical accounts. The legendary [John D. Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/) runs a number of them, like [UnixToolTip](https://twitter.com/UnixToolTip/). Inspired by the [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) learning technique, getting some quick tips, tricks, and use cases about unix every day can help you learn some new moves in the command line.\n",
